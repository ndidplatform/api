## 2.0.0 (May 29, 2019)

_Compatible with: [`smart-contract`](https://github.com/ndidplatform/smart-contract) v3.0.0_

There are a number of significant changes in this release. Some of major changes:

- Introduces mode 2 which is closely similar to mode 3 but without the need for consent request when modifying identity (e.g. create identity/onboarding, add/revoke accessor) on the platform, instead IdPs will get notifications on what kind of modification of which identity has occured on the platform.
- Support for multiple namespaces+identifiers or SIDs as a single identity called reference group.
- API version 1 and 2 have been removed as they are not compatible with multiple SIDs, new mode 2 and 3 flows and other changes such as supported namespaces declared by AS for each service.

  - Add `request_message` optional property to POST `/identity` and POST `/identity/:namespace/:identifier/accessors`

FEATURES:

- Add new API: GET `/identity/requests/reference/:reference_id` for getting request ID and accessor ID of an unfinished create identity request.
- Validate HTTP request body for NDID APIs.

IMPROVEMENTS:

  - Add `data_salt` and `signature_sign_method` properties to data from AS when querying on RP side. (GET `/rp/requests/data/:request_id`) This change also applies to API v1.
  - Separate `valid_proof` into `valid_signature` (accessor signature) and `valid_proof` (ZK proof). This change also applies to API v1. Affect the following APIs:
    - RP Callback type `request_status` in property `response_valid_list`
    - GET `/utility/requests/:request_id`
- Change how `request_message_hash` in IdP callback with type `incoming_request` is generated.
- Change expected `signature` sending with POST `/idp/response`. It should be created by encrypting `request_message_hash` given with `incoming_request` callback without padding.
- Remove `ALLOW_DEBUG_API` environment variable option. Debug APIs are available in development mode and inaccessible in production environment.

IMPROVEMENTS:

- API version 2.1, New APIs:
